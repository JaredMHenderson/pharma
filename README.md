QuickClinic is an app for pharmacists to use to keep track of their patients and medications.

Upon opening the app, the pharmacist will be given a list of recent patients, displaying their name, DOB, prescriptions, and comments. 

The pharmacist can add patients and prescriptions, delete patients and prescriptions, and update prescriptions.
