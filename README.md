QuickClinic is an app for pharmacists to use to keep track of their patients and medications.

Upon opening the app, the pharmacist will be given a list of the most recent 5 patients whose records have been viewed, displaying their name, DOB, address, date of last visit, ailments, and allergies. 

The pharmacist will also be able to search for patients by these same categories (name, DOB, address, date of last visit, ailments, and allergies) and add new patients.

The pharmacist will be able to access a database which monitors medication in stock. He/she will be able to add or subtract stock of individual medications as well as add new medications, or remove them from the shelf.
